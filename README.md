# Introduction
The easiest and most widely used method for deploying machine learning models is to wrap them inside a REST API.

## what is FastAPI?
It’s a modern and fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+. Performance-wise, it’s up there with NodeJS and Go, and that tells you something. It is also easy enough to learn and comes with automatic interactive documentation


# Prerequisites
- FastAPI installation and building the first API
- Interactive documentation exploration
- Training a machine learning model
- Building a complete REST API
- Testing
- Conclusion
